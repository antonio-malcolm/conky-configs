**Conky configs and Lua scripts, by Antonio Malcolm (v2015.07.26)**

This is a collection of conky configs I've written, and thought to share, for those who might like to use them with their own systems.  
I should probably mention these configs **use the most recent Conky, which utilizes Lua syntax in conkyrc**  
That said, it should be trivial to revert the conkryc files to work with older Conky versions.  
Of course, the Lua scripts will require a Conky built with the appropriate Lua bindings for Cairo and imlib2.  
As of the latest Conky, XDBE must also be built in, if you wish to use double-buffering.  

Screenshots can be found under **[SCREENSHOTS](SCREENSHOTS)**  
Wallpapers, as featured in the screenshots, can be found under **[WALLPAPERS](WALLPAPERS)**  

All conkyrc configs and lua scripts provided here are written by me, and come with an MPL, v2 license (open source), unless otherwise noted.  
Fonts which accompany the configs are also open source, and are accompanied with a copy of whichever open source license is applicable.  

**A NOTE ABOUT THE WALLPAPERS**

I don't create all the wallpapers here- like many wallpapers in use, they're often found around the internet, often with NO copyright info.  
All applicable copyright info, when available with a wallpaper, will be included.  
Otherwise, you use the wallpaper at your own risk (minimal, most likely, as it is used privately, on your own machine).
